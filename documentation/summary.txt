I'm most proud of the project that I am currently working on, my personal blog. The technology stack involved is: ReactJS for front-end, NodeJS and KoaJS for back-end & mySQL and GraphQL for database. This blog allows users to login, like and comment on posts. This blog includes user authentication and authorization. The admin can manage users as well as publish blog posts. Features like pagination and filtering blogs according to specific tags are also implemented. The UI of the blog is simple and sleek. It is responsive and design libraries are used minimally. Ant design is used for icons and pagination component. The 'Featured' section of home page is displayed in a grid masonry fashion. Coming to the database part, many-to-many relationships are avoided by using associative tables. A detailed ERD diagram is available in the 'documentation' folder of the project repository. mySQL was chosen as the database of this application as this is going to be a small-scale application. Moreover, I wanted to implement the teachings of DBMS. Migration scripts were written for convinient database setup. GraphQL was used for querying the data from the database. The structure , the functional behavior as well as the optimized queries that GraphQL offers were ideal for this project. Minor implementation details like implementing advanced JavaScript currying, building a component renderer instead of hardcoding Route tags were a great learning experience for me. In the coming time, a blog post viewer and CMS will be added along with blog post page front-end implementation. This is a passion project and seeing it come to fruition day by day, there's no better feeling.
